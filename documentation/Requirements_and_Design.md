## 2. Project Description

Struggling to find relevant interview questions is a thing of the past. Our AI-powered platform tackles this by taking your uploaded job posting and generating a highly tailored set of practice materials. This includes role-specific coding challenges, system design problems, and behavioral interview questions. To ensure you're interview-ready, you can input and track your progress against these personalized lists, and refine your soft skills with the mock interview, which provides instant feedback to hone your behavioural question delivery.

This comprehensive tool extends beyond just preparation by helping users discover new opportunities and build community. Based on the initial job information provided, the platform intelligently suggests comparable roles, broadening the user's career search and expanding their practice scope. Furthermore, users can engage in peer-to-peer learning by creating or joining discussion groups, allowing them to share recent interview experiences, discuss preparation strategies, and exchange insights with others pursuing similar roles. This integrated approach ensures a personalized, efficient, and collaborative journey toward securing their desired position.

## 3. Requirements Specification

### **3.1. List of Features**

#### 1. Authentication
To access app features, a user must Sign In using Google Authentication Service first. New users should Sign Up before Signing In. An authenticated user can Sign Out. Users can also delete their account from the appâ€™s database.

#### 2. Manage job applications
This feature allows users to build a personalized portfolio of job opportunities they're interested in. Users have two options for adding job postings: they can either paste the job posting content directly (copying and pasting the job description text into a text field) or paste a link to the job posting from career websites.

The system stores and organizes these job applications as a searchable, clickable list where each entry displays the job title and company name. Users can view all their saved job applications in this centralized list and must click on a specific job application to use it for generating interview questions. 

#### 3. Generate questions
For each job application, the user can request relevant coding and behavioral questions. Upon request, the app gathers a curated set of interview questions by leveraging a community LeetCode API to gather coding and system design questions tailored to the job description and OpenAI for behavioral questions. The app then displays two options: Technical Questions and Behavioral Questions, which the user can choose from.

Additionally, the app automatically tracks and displays the user's completion progress across each set of generated questions, allowing them to monitor their overall preparation status for that specific job application.

#### 4. Solving technical questions
If the user selects Technical Questions, the app displays a list of relevant coding and system design questions. When the user taps on a question, they are redirected to the appropriate external platform (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank) where they can practice and solve the problem in a real coding environment. After solving the questions, the user can mark the question as completed which increments their overall technical progress tracker.

#### 5. Mock Interviews
If the user selects Behavioural Questions, the app displays a list of behavioural questions. A user can start a mock interview session for behavioral questions. When the user taps the "Start Mock Interview" button, the app redirects them to a dedicated mock interview screen where the behavioral questions are displayed.

The user can type their answer to each behavioral question. After submitting an answer, the app uses the OpenAI API to analyze the response and provide detailed feedback, then it automatically marks the question as complete.

The user can then end the mock interview or proceed through all the behavioral questions in the mock interview session. Once the session is complete, the app uses the OpenAI API to generate a summary of the user's performance, including feedback for each question and an overall assessment of their responses.

#### 6. Find similar jobs
For each job application, the user can search for similar job postings. Upon request, the app searches for job positions with the same or similar titles currently available on the market. The app then calculates the distance between each job location and the user's location to filter for nearby opportunities, as well as identifies remote positions.

The app displays a curated list of similar job postings. When the user taps on a job posting, the app displays the full job details, including the company name, job description, location, and a link to apply. The user can then choose to save the job posting to their job applications.

#### 7. Manage discussions
A user can create a discussion and provide the discussion topic (e.g., "Amazon SDE Interview" or "Google Behavioral Tips").

Any user can browse a list of active discussions and find discussions relevant to their job search. They will be able to view all discussion chats. Users can post messages to share their interview experiences, ask questions, and engage with others who have applied to similar positions or companies.

### **3.7. Non-Functional Requirements**

**NFR-1: API Response Time**

*   **Requirement:** All backend API endpoints must respond with a **p95 response time â‰¤ 3 seconds** under normal load conditions (â‰¤ 100 concurrent requests across all endpoints).

    
*   **Why it matters:** Users interact with multiple features during interview prep; consistently fast response times across the entire system ensure a smooth user experience regardless of which feature they use.



**NFR-2: System Scalability**

*   **Requirement:** The system must support **at least 50 concurrent users** performing mixed operations (job management, question generation, discussion participation) with **â‰¤ 5% request failure rate** and maintaining response times within NFR-1 limits.

    
*   **Why it matters:** The application must handle multiple simultaneous users across all features without degradation; poor scalability leads to failures during peak usage times when students are actively preparing.



**NFR-3: Data Integrity and Consistency**

*   **Requirement:** The system must maintain **100% data consistency** across all CRUD operations with **zero data loss** during concurrent access. Specifically: (1) All created jobs, questions, and discussions must be successfully stored and retrievable, (2) Question completion status updates must be atomic and accurately reflected, (3) Concurrent message posts to the same discussion must all be saved without overwriting.
    
    
*   **Why it matters:** Users trust the system to accurately track their interview preparation progress; data loss or inconsistency (e.g., losing completed questions, missing discussion messages) severely damages user trust and application usefulness.

    ### 4.2. Databases
    
    ### 
    
    *   **MongoDB** (NoSQL database) in a larger scale project we would have used multiple databases for separation of concerns; however, to reduce overhead we will only be using one with multiple collections.

        
    
    Collections:

    1. **users**
        - **Purpose:** Store user authentication info, profile data, and ownership of content.

    2. **jobApplications** (or **jobs**)
        - **Purpose:** Store user's saved job applications, including title, company, location, description, skills, status, and application dates.

    3. **questions**
        - **Purpose:** Store generated technical and behavioral questions for each job, with status (pending, completed), difficulty, tags, and external URLs.

    4. **sessions**
        - **Purpose:** Track active mock interview sessions, including current question index, answers, progress, and session state (active/completed/cancelled).

    5. **discussions**
        - **Purpose:** Contain discussion metadata (topic, description, creator) AND embedded messages array (not a separate collection).
        - **Structure:** Each discussion document contains `messages[]` subdocuments with userId, userName, content, timestamps.
    

    6. **availableJobs**
        - **Purpose:** Store scraped job postings from external sources (Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.) for similar job search functionality.
     

    * * *
    
    ### 4.3. External Modules
    
    ### 
    
    1. **Community LeetCode API**
        
        *   **Purpose:** Retrieve coding and system design questions relevant to job postings.
            
    2. **Google OAuth API**
        
        *   **Purpose:** Manage user authentication and sign-in with Google accounts.
            
    3. **OpenAI API**
        
        *   **Purpose:** Generate behavioral interview questions from job descriptions and provide feedback on user answers.

    4. **Websocket**

        *   **Purpose:** Enable real-time communication for discussion forums, broadcasting new discussion creation and real-time message delivery to connected users in discussion rooms.
    
    5. **Web Scraper (Puppeteer/Cheerio)**

        *   **Purpose:** Extract job postings from external career sites (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, RemoteOK, Stack Overflow Jobs, GitHub Jobs) to provide similar job recommendations. Scrapes job titles, descriptions, locations, salaries, and requirements from multiple sources to expand job search beyond manually entered applications.


            
            
    
    * * *
    
    ### 4.4. Frameworks
    
    ### 
    
    1. **Express.js**
        
        *   **Purpose:** Backend framework for API routing and business logic.
            
        *   **Reason:** Lightweight, scalable, and familiar to the development team.
            
    2. **Azure VM**
        
        *   **Purpose:** Host backend services and database in the cloud.
            
        *   **Reason:** Strong support for scalability and the teamâ€™s prior experience.


### **4.5. Dependencies Diagram**

**Note:**
- currenlty for the mvp each job is owned or stored by a user as a job model requires a user id; hence the dependency. However for scalability we might be changing that in later milestones.
- We decided to keep the sessions (even though in the lab we said we wouldn't) because it was simpler to code as it provided more separation of concerns.

### **4.7. Design and Ways to Test Non-Functional Requirements**

**NFR-1: API Response Time**  
**Validation:**

*   Load-test all major endpoints (`POST /questions/generate`, `GET /jobs`, `POST /discussions`, `PUT /questions/{id}/toggle`) with 100 concurrent users using **k6/JMeter/Locust**: ramp 2 min â†’ steady 10 min. Pass if **p95 â‰¤ 3s** for all endpoints and overall error rate < 1%.
    
*   Measure individual endpoint latency under normal load (10 concurrent users) for 5 minutes. Pass if lightweight endpoints (`GET /jobs`, `GET /discussions`) achieve **p95 â‰¤ 500ms** and heavy endpoints (`POST /questions/generate`) achieve **p95 â‰¤ 8s**.
    
*   Monitor backend logs and APM tools (Azure Application Insights/New Relic) during load tests. Pass if database query times remain **< 200ms p95** and external API calls (OpenAI/LeetCode) are properly timeout-handled.

* * *

**NFR-2: System Scalability**  
**Validation:**

*   Concurrent user simulation with **Locust/k6**: simulate 50 virtual users executing mixed realistic workflows (login â†’ create job â†’ generate questions â†’ browse discussions â†’ post message) continuously for 15 minutes. Pass if **error rate â‰¤ 5%**, **p95 response time â‰¤ 3s**, and **zero server crashes**.
    
*   Resource monitoring during load test: track CPU usage, memory consumption, database connection pool utilization, and network I/O using monitoring tools (Docker stats, Azure Monitor, Grafana). Pass if **CPU < 80%**, **memory < 85%**, **DB connections < 80% of pool limit**.
    
*   Stress test beyond capacity: gradually increase concurrent users from 50 â†’ 100 â†’ 150 until system degrades. Pass if system handles **at least 50 users** gracefully and provides **clear degradation signals** (503 responses, queue full messages) rather than silent failures when overloaded.

* * *

**NFR-3: Data Integrity and Consistency**  
**Validation:**

*   CRUD consistency tests using **automated integration tests (Jest/JUnit/Pytest)**: Create 100 jobs, 100 questions, and 50 discussions via API calls. Retrieve all records and verify **100% match** (no missing data, correct attributes). Pass if **zero data loss** across 10 test runs.
    
*   Concurrency race condition tests: Simulate 20 concurrent users toggling the same question's completion status 50 times each (total 1000 toggles). Verify final state matches expected count. Simulate 50 concurrent users posting messages to the same discussion simultaneously. Pass if **all 50 messages saved** with correct timestamps and **no overwrites/corruption**.
    
*   Database integrity checks: Run MongoDB validation commands (`db.collection.validate()`) on all collections after load tests and concurrent operations. Query for orphaned records (questions without jobs, messages without discussions). Pass if **zero orphaned records** and **all foreign key relationships intact**.
    
*   Transaction rollback tests: Simulate failures during multi-step operations (e.g., create job + generate questions). Force failures midway and verify **atomic rollback** (no partial data). Pass if database remains consistent with **no incomplete transactions**.
